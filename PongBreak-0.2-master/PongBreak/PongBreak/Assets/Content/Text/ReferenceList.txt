I couldn't figure out how to use Cocossharp's menu functionality (particularly the use of
CCMenu and CCMenuItem, respectively). The stackoverflow answer by jaybers allowed us to create
a similar type of effect using CCSprite.

I wanted to create a tileable background using CocosSharp but had some troubles making it display properly.
In part 4 of Luke's Youtube tutorial series, he displays code that creates a repeatable background using
the CreateBackground method. The code has been altered slightly for this project, as it has different
argument requirements and variable names.

Reference HandleTouchesMoved in LevelOne.cs, LevelTwo.cs, LevelThree.cs,
I was following on from the CocosSharp tutorial (by xamarin) video used to set up the initial project, but
the code that they used to move the paddle seemed really choppy, so ultimately I used the code from 
the Lab 3 Bouncing Ball game to create smoother paddle movement.

The project began as a template (empty) Cocossharp project, which is available from CocosSharp.
Sample code was viewed to get a better understanding of CocosSharp's methods and frameworks, these samples
can be found here https://github.com/mono/cocos-sharp-samples
